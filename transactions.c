/* This file is not ready yet but we need to implement
this for the Information Security class.

1. The merkleRoot is a binary tree built with the SHA256 hashes
of all the transactions which will be stored in the block

2. The digitalSignature will use the RSA Signature algorithm
to validate who owns the transaction

3. The getPublicKey will be used by each user to get the publickey
from their privatekey
