# Blockchain-Research-Group-YachayTech

We are a undergraduate student group focused on Blockchain technology.
To learn about the core features we are trying to build our own blockchain
from strach, replicating the first Bitcoin Blokchain concept.

To try our code:

1. Download the files
2. Unzip the files in one folder
3. Run this in the command line: gcc -o test main.c PoW.c sha256.c file.c -I.
4. Run this in the command line: ./test
5. See how it goes :)

If you have any suggestions to our code or you want to collaborate with us please 
do not hesitate in writing a comment or contact us to nicolas.serrano@yachaytech.edu.ec
